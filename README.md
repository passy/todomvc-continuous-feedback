## HTML5/Javascript WebApp build best practice 
__*a practitioners' guide*__

Modern browsers allow us to build large and complex "single page" WebApps.

Ensuring you can continuously deliver new features and work in a team requires the adoption of a series of best practice engineering disciplines that might be unfamiliar if you have only worked on single developer JQuery augmented websites before.

This project is a community driven example of these engineering best practices in use with the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) WebApp(s)

### Getting started

Read the following:

1. Components of a complete build process
1. Tour of complete system in action - releasing a new feature
